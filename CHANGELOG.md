# Changelog

## 29-10-2025

- monorepo package manager was changed to pnpm@10, and workspace settings were configured to prevent installation of recently published packages. This change, along with explicitly fixed dependency versions, should minimize the risk of publishing packages that depend on a recently published newer version of a dependency
- monorepo package dependencies were unified via pnpm workspace
- monorepo was formatted with the latest [biome](https://biomejs.dev) default rules
- monorepo tsconfig was refactored from being a package to just a file in the root

### @ston-fi/sdk@2.6.0

#### Added

- [@ton/ton@16](https://github.com/ton-org/ton/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1600---2025-10-03) was added as possible peerDependency

## 02-07-2025

### @ston-fi/stake-sdk@1.2.0

Introducing a new SDK to the monorepo family. `@ston-fi/stake-sdk` will let you perform operations on Ston.fi Stake contracts

More information about the new SDK you can find in its [README](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk/tree/main/packages/stake-sdk/README.md)

### @ston-fi/sdk@2.5.0

#### Added

- new `fromUnits`, `toUnits` utils

The @ton/core utils do not allow specifying decimals and expect all jettons to have exactly 9 decimals. [(source code)](https://github.com/ton-org/ton-core/blob/main/src/utils/convert.ts)

```ts
import { toNano } from "@ton/ton";

const tonUnits = toNano("1");
// ^ 1000000000n
// Correct for jettons with default decimals

const usdtUnits = toNano("1");
// ^ 1000000000n
// Invalid for jettons with custom decimals
// USDT (EQCxE6mUtQJKFnGfaROTKOt1lZbDiiX1kCixRv7Nw2Id_sDs) has 6 decimals
```

Our version of the same utils has a different name to avoid conflict with your local usage of @tpn/core utils and allows you to specify custom decimals.

```ts
import { toUnits } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

const tonUnits = toUnits("1"); // the default decimals value is 9
// ^ 1000000000n

const usdtUnits = toUnits("1", 6);
// ^ 1000000n
```

## [2.4.1]

### Fixed

- correct `Farm.getClaimRewardsTxParams` gas calculation for pools with 0 rewards

## [2.4.0]

With this release, we are adding two new Router & Pool types:
- `WCPI`
- `WStable`

Previously we used BaseRouter/BasePool classes to call the contract classes but because new contracts are unique we are more leaning from the Base* contract approach to the explicit one. So it should work like this:

```ts
export const DEX = {
 Router: {
  CPI: CPIRouterV2_2,
  Stable: StableRouterV2_2,
  WCPI: WCPIRouterV2_2,
  WStable: WStableRouterV2_2,
 },
 Pool: {
  CPI: CPIPoolV2_2,
  Stable: StablePoolV2_2,
  WCPI: WCPIPoolV2_2,
  WStable: WStablePoolV2_2,
 },
 LpAccount: LpAccountV2_2,
 Vault: VaultV2_2,
 pTON: PtonV2_1,
};
```

So Because of the contracts uniq moments code like this `DEX.Router.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams()` will not work correctly in all cases. We are deprecating the method calls on `DEX.Router` and `DEX.Pool` classes. In the next versions, they will become just objects.
The new preferable way to do such calls is `DEX.Router.CPI.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams()`

So the expected diff to support new contract calls in your code following:

```diff
- const swapTxParams = await DEX.Router.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams()
+ const swapTxParams = await DEX.Router.CPI.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams()
```

This logic of defining the correct router/pool type to use might be complicated, but the good part is that if you are using our `dexFactory` or `routerFactory` helper function it will select the contracts of the needed type for you **automatically** if `routerType` parameter is provided!

So this is how it works:

```ts
import { StonApiClient } from "@ston-fi/api";
import { dexFactory } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

const stonApi = new StonApiClient();

const routerInfo = await stonApi.getRouter("EQCS4UEa5UaJLzOyyKieqQOQ2P9M-7kXpkO5HnP3Bv250cN3");

// ^ {
//   address: 'EQCS4UEa5UaJLzOyyKieqQOQ2P9M-7kXpkO5HnP3Bv250cN3',
//   majorVersion: 2,
//   minorVersion: 2,
//   routerType: 'ConstantProduct',
//   ...
// }

const contracts = dexFactory(routerInfo);

// ^ {
//     Router: CPIRouterV2_2,
//     Pool: CPIPoolV2_2,
//     LpAccount: LpAccountV2_2,
//     Vault: VaultV2_2,
//     pTON: PtonV2_1
// }
```

### Added

- new `WCPI` contracts

 Could be accessed like this

  ```ts
  import { DEX } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

  const router = DEX.v2_2.Router.WCPI;
  const pool = DEX.v2_2.Pool.WCPI;
  ```

 Or like this

  ```ts
  import { WCPIRouterV2_2, WCPIPoolV2_2 } from "@ston-fi/sdk/dex/v2_2";
  ```

- new `WStable` contracts

 Could be accessed like this

  ```ts
  import { DEX } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

  const router = DEX.v2_2.Router.WStable;
  const pool = DEX.v2_2.Pool.WStable;
  ```

 Or like this

  ```ts
  import { WStableRouterV2_2, WStablePoolV2_2 } from "@ston-fi/sdk/dex/v2_2";
  ```

### Changed

- The `Router` & `Pool` fields returned by the `dexFactory` method became a specific class instead of a Base* class. So after an update, code like this will not work

  ```ts
  const contracts = dexFactory(routerInfo).Router.CPI; // Property 'CPI' does not exist
  ```

 We are not expecting many of you to face these breaking changes, but in case of need, we temporarily add new fields to simplify migration.
 All you need to do is to use `_Router` instead of `Router` and `_Pool` instead of `_Pool` correspondently.

  ```ts
  const contracts = dexFactory(routerInfo)._Router.CPI; // will work but deprecated. Should `.Router` should be used instead.
  ```

 But we are not recommending doing that since new `_*` fields are instances of Base* contracts and their usage with the routers of new types might lead to failed transactions.

### Deprecated

- methods calls on the Base* classes are deprecated and will be removed in the next versions;

  ```diff
  - const swapTxParams = await DEX.Router.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams()
  + const swapTxParams = await DEX.Router.CPI.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams()
  ```

## [2.3.0]

### Added

- for all operations that are jetton transfers new optional `transferExcessAddress` parameter was added. This new parameter allows to send jetton transfer excess gas to another wallet than the wallet that made the transfer
  - `Router.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams`
  - `Router.getSwapJettonToTonTxParams`
  - `Router.getProvideLiquidityJettonTxParams`
  - `Router.getSingleSideProvideLiquidityJettonTxParams`
  - `FarmMinter.getStakeTxParams`
- for Farm v3 `getFarmingMinterData` method `farmDataParameters` obj was extended with the `rampDays` field for farms v3.2+

### Fixed

- correct type declaration for `FarmNftMinterV3.FarmDataParameters.status` in JsDoc comment

### Chore

- all non-build related dev dependencies updated to their latest versions

## [2.2.3]

### Fixed

- we notices that more than 12k$ of swap fees was send to the [hole address](https://tonviewer.com/EQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAM9c). Since those fees can never be claimed, they are lost forever. To prevent this loss, zero address will be ignored if used as a `referralAddress` for swap transactions.
- fix one of the `BaseRouterV2_1.createCrossSwapBody` test cases

## [2.2.2]

### Fixed

- correct "Jetton Burn" message creation according to the [standard](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#2-burn) creation for `PoolV1` contract.
- we found that `BaseRouterV2_1.getProvideLiquidityTonTxParams` and `BaseRouterV2_1.getSingleSideProvideLiquidityTonTxParams` methods had unused `bothPositive` arguments that are not intended to be configurable. To avoid breaking existing code bases, instead of deleting them, we deprecated these fields.

## [2.2.1]

### Changed

- since the SDK package expects `@ston-fi/api@0.7.0` as peer dependency and this version was the first one ever released, the version declaration for api package was simplified from `>=0.7.0 <1.0.0` to just `^0`

## [2.2.0]

### Changed

- Instead of specific Pton contracts, Router methods will accept any Pton contract that implements the `AbstractPton` interface. We were forced to implement this solution besides the fact that now you will not get the TS error during the development if the unmatched Pton contract is passed to the Router contract. But we implemented the runtime validation of the Pton version to prevent the appearance of transactions with the unmatched pTON version

### Added

- even more tests for CIP and StableSwap contracts
- added import of only `v2_2` DEX contracts from sdk via submodule

### Fixed

- `UnmatchedPtonVersion` expected and received fields now type of `pTON_VERSION` instead of `DEX_VERSION`
- correct `repository` field in sdk package.json file

## [2.1.0]

### Added

- new [stable swap](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/architecture#stableswap) contracts `DEX.v2_*.Router.Stable` and `DEX.v2_*.Pool.Stable`

### Fixed

- `DEX.v2_2.Pool.getLpAccount` now will return correct `LpAccountV2_2` instance instead of `LpAccountV2_1`

## [2.0.1]

### Fixed

- fix missed README.md file for the SDK package in NPM registry

## [2.0.0]

- `2.0.0-rc.11` was tagged as stable release `2.0.0`

## [2.0.0-rc.11]

### Added

- optional `receiverAddress` parameter was added to the `BaseRouterV2_1` contract methods. By default, it will be equal to `userWalletAddress`

## [2.0.0-rc.10]

### Changed

- the project structure was changed to monorepo
- as an result of the research on [@Siykt](https://github.com/Siykt) [issue](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk/issues/41) package build tool was changed from vite to tsup

### Fixed

- correct description for the `PoolV1.getExpectedOutputs` method `jettonWallet` parameter. Thanks to [@Ludwintor](https://github.com/Ludwintor) for finding [this issue](https://github.com/ston-fi/sdk/issues/43).
- correct declaration of the `@ston-fi/api` package version to prevent npm warnings
- `DEX.v2_2.Pool.getLpAccount` method now will return correct `LpAccountV2_2` instance instead of `LpAccountV2_1`
- `DEX.v2_2.Router.getPool` method now will return correct `BasePoolV2_2` instance instead of `BasePoolV2_1`
- `DEX.v2_2.Router.getVault` method now will return correct `VaultV2_2` instance instead of `VaultV2_1`

## [2.0.0-rc.9]

### Fixed

- `DEX.v2_2.Router.CPI.version` now will return correct `v2_2` value instead of `v2_1`
- `DEX.v2_2.Pool.CPI` was mistakenly nested from the `CPIRouterV2_1` class instead of `CPIPoolV2_1`

## [2.0.0-rc.8]

### Added

- DEX v2.2 contracts (`Router`, `Pool`, `LpAccount`, `Vault`);

## [2.0.0-rc.7]

### Changed

- Because of the frequent cases of pTON contracts being used with the uncopiable Router we changed the type declaration of the pTON in the Router contracts to allow only the pTON contract with the same version as the Router. Now Error will be thrown in case of mismatching versions

```ts
const router = client.open(DEX.v2_1.Router.create('EQ...'));

const txParams = await router.getSwapTonToJettonTxParams({
  // ...
  proxyTon: pTON.v1.create('EQ...'),
});

// [Error]: The version of the provided pTON (v1) does not match the expected version (v2_1)
```

- `Contract.create` method generic type declaration were rewritten to solve an issue with inferring the contract type. Before, following code caused a ts error, and now it will work just fine

```ts
const router: RouterV1 | RouterV2_1;

router.create('EQ...')
// ^
// The 'this' context of type 'typeof RouterV1 | typeof RouterV2_1'
//   is not assignable to method's 'this' of type 'new (address: AddressType) => RouterV1'.
// Types of construct signatures are incompatible.
```

### Added

- pTON contract was added to the `DEX` object exported for each dex version to simplify it usage and illuminate additional import.

```ts
import { DEX } from '@ston-fi/sdk/dex/v2_1';

const { Router, pTON } = DEX;
```

- `dexFactory` helper was added. This method will return the DEX object with all needed contracts of the correct version based on `majorVersion` & `minorVersion` fields from the RouterInfo from the API

```ts
import { StonApiClient } from "@ston-fi/api";
import { dexFactory } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

const apiClient = new StonApiClient();

const routerInfo = await apiClient.getRouter('EQ...');

const dex = dexFactory(routerInfo);

const router = dex.Router.create(routerInfo.address);
const pTON = dex.pTON.create(routerInfo.ptonMasterAddress);
```

- `routerFactory` helper was added. This method is similar to the `dexFactory` and also requires the RouterInfo from the API as an argument. As a result, it will return the Router contract instance of the correct version initialized with the `address` from the RouterInfo object

- `@ton/ton@^15.0.0` was listed as a valid peer dependency

## [2.0.0-rc.6]

### Added

- Router v2_1 address validation has been added. It will throw an error if Router v2_1 is initialized with the v1 address. This is needed to prevent users from fund loss caused by the operation execution on an invalid router version
- All test snapshots were updated with values from actual v2_1 contracts

## [2.0.0-rc.5]

### Changed

- dex `v2` was deprecated and removed from the SDK. A new version, `v2_1,` was introduced instead.
  `v2` contracts were only deployed in the testnet and will never be deployed in the main net.
  `v2_1` has a few changes in comparison to the previous version:
  - some operation codes were changed
  - The optional parameter `deadline` was added to the swap & liquidity provide operations. This parameter is motivated by blockchain issues with TX processing that happen occasionally at a high load. If the transaction execution takes more time than defined by the `deadline` (15 min by default), the transaction will bounce.

The migration from `v2` to `v2_1` is pretty simple:

```diff
const router = client.open(
--  DEX.v2.Router.create(
++  DEX.v2_1.Router.create(
--    "kQCas2p939ESyXM_BzFJzcIe3GD5S0tbjJDj6EBVn-SPsEkN" // CPI Router v2.0.0
++    "kQALh-JBBIKK7gr0o4AVf9JZnEsFndqO0qTCyT-D-yBsWk0v" // CPI Router v2.1.0
  )
);
```

- pTON `v2` was deprecated and removed from the SDK. A new version, `v2_1,` was introduced instead.
  `v2` contracts were only deployed in the testnet and will never be deployed in the main net.

The migration from `v2` to `v2_1` is pretty simple:

```diff
-- const proxyTon = pTON.v2.create(
++ const proxyTon = pTON.v2_1.create(
--  "kQDwpyxrmYQlGDViPk-oqP4XK6J11I-bx7fJAlQCWmJB4m74" // pTON v2.0.0
++  "kQACS30DNoUQ7NfApPvzh7eBmSZ9L4ygJ-lkNWtba8TQT-Px" // pTON v2.1.0
);
```

### Added

- Because of the recent appearance of the [Mintless Jettons](https://gist.github.com/EmelyanenkoK/bfe633bdf8e22ca92a5138e59134988f) ability to pass `custom_payload` to [jetton transfer message](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/TEPs/blob/master/text/0074-jettons-standard.md#1-transfer) became a necessity, optional `jettonCustomPayload` parameter was added to all dex operations that are jettonTransfer's
  - swap
    - `RouterV1.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams`
    - `RouterV1.getSwapJettonToTonTxParams`
    - `RouterV2_1.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams`
    - `RouterV2_1.getSwapJettonToTonTxParams`
  - liquidity provision
    - `RouterV1.getProvideLiquidityJettonTxParams`
    - `RouterV2_1.getProvideLiquidityJettonTxParams`
    - `RouterV2_1.getSingleSideProvideLiquidityJettonTxParams`

Here is an example of how swap with non yet minted [Points](https://tonviewer.com/EQD6Z9DHc5Mx-8PI8I4BjGX0d2NhapaRAK12CgstweNoMint) jetton could be achieved

```ts
  import { WalletContractV4, TonClient, Cell, internal, toNano } from "@ton/ton";
  import { mnemonicToPrivateKey } from "@ton/crypto";
  import { DEX } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

  const client = new TonClient({
    endpoint: 'https://toncenter.com/api/v2/jsonRPC',
    apiKey: '', // specify API key to avoid rate limits
  });

  const keyPair = await mnemonicToPrivateKey([]);

  const offerJettonAddress = 'EQD6Z9DHc5Mx-8PI8I4BjGX0d2NhapaRAK12CgstweNoMint'; // Mintless Points
  const askJettonAddress = 'EQCM3B12QK1e4yZSf8GtBRT0aLMNyEsBc_DhVfRRtOEffLez'; // pTON v1

  const wallet = client.open(WalletContractV4.create({ workchain: 0, publicKey: keyPair.publicKey }));

  // 1. request jetton data, to verify should claim be preformed or not

  const offerJettonData = await (fetch(`https://tonapi.io/v2/accounts/${wallet.address.toString()}/jettons/${offerJettonAddress}?supported_extensions=custom_payload`).then((res) => res.json()));

  console.log('offerJettonData', offerJettonData);

  let customPayload: Cell | undefined;
  let stateInit: { code: Cell, data: Cell } | undefined;

  // 2. if jetton is not minted, request the `custom_payload` and `state_init` for it

  if (offerJettonData.extensions?.includes('custom_payload')) {
    const offerJettonCustomPayload = await (fetch(`${offerJettonData.jetton.custom_payload_api_uri}/wallet/${wallet.address.toString()}`).then((res) => res.json()));

    const customPayload = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(offerJettonCustomPayload.custom_payload, 'base64'))[0];
    const stateInitCell = Cell.fromBoc(Buffer.from(offerJettonCustomPayload.state_init, 'base64'))[0].beginParse();

    stateInit = {
      code: stateInitCell.loadRef(),
      data: stateInitCell.loadRef(),
    };
  }

  // 3. build swap tx params with custom payload if needed

  const router = client.open(DEX.v1.Router.create(DEX.v1.Router.address));
  const txParams = await router.getSwapJettonToJettonTxParams({
    userWalletAddress: wallet.address,
    askJettonAddress,
    offerJettonAddress,
    offerAmount: toNano(0.1),
    minAskAmount: 1,
    jettonCustomPayload: customPayload,
    // slightly increase gas amount to avoid out of gas error in case if init is required
    gasAmount: stateInit ? DEX.v1.Router.gasConstants.swapJettonToJetton.gasAmount + toNano(0.1) : undefined,
  });

  // 4. send swap tx to the network with state init if needed

  await wallet.sendTransfer({
    seqno: await wallet.getSeqno(),
    secretKey: keyPair.secretKey,
    messages: [internal({
      ...txParams,
      init: stateInit,
    })],
  })
}
```

> **Breaking changes**
> Please look at the **Changed** section or at the [step-by-step migration guide](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/sdk/0.5-migration-guide)

During the development of the DEX v2 contracts, we identified several feature gaps in the [tonweb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb) package, which our SDK relied on. Additionally, a survey within the DEV community revealed that most developers use the [ton-org](https://github.com/ton-org) packages in their projects. Consequently, we have decided to migrate from [tonweb](https://github.com/toncenter/tonweb) to [ton-org](https://github.com/ton-org) packages as our core dependency.

We understand that this change may be unexpected and require additional work for some of you. However, we believe this move is necessary and beneficial in the long run. Our team has already completed this migration in our product, and it was a smooth transition. Moreover, projects already using the ton-center package will benefit from a significant reduction in dependencies.

This release is functionally fully equivalent to the previous stable release, `0.5.3`

### Changed

- The contract constructor interface signature was changed

Address now is the first parameter for the contract constructor instead of the named field in the configuration object

```diff
const router = new DEX.v1.Router(
- {
-   address: "EQB3ncyBUTjZUA5EnFKR5_EnOMI9V1tTEAAPaiU71gc4TiUt",
- }
+ "EQB3ncyBUTjZUA5EnFKR5_EnOMI9V1tTEAAPaiU71gc4TiUt"
);
```

SDK contracts no longer require `tonApiClient` to be passed in each contract constructor.
By design of the ton-core library, contracts should be opened with a provider to make on-chain requests.

```diff
const router = new DEX.v1.Router(
- {
-   tonApiClient: new TonWeb.HttpProvider('https://ton-api.ston.fi/jsonRPC'),
- }
);
```

Custom `gasConstants` could be specified in the contract configuration object that could be passed as the second argument to the constructor.

```diff
const router = new DEX.v1.Router(
- {
-   address: "EQB3ncyBUTjZUA5EnFKR5_EnOMI9V1tTEAAPaiU71gc4TiUt",
-   gasConstants: { /** */ }
- }
+ "EQB3ncyBUTjZUA5EnFKR5_EnOMI9V1tTEAAPaiU71gc4TiUt",
+ { gasConstants: { /** */ } }
);
```

- `build*TxParams` methods was renamed to `get*TxParams`

```diff
- const txParams = await router.buildSwapTonToJettonTxParams({ /** */ });

+ const txParams = await router.getSwapTonToJettonTxParams({ /** */ });
```

- Amount is now represented in native js `BigInt` instead of `BN` from [bn.js](https://github.com/indutny/bn.js)

You can replace `BN` usage with `BigInt` OR use strings, and SDK will wrap them in BigInt under the hood.

```diff
const txParams = await router.getSwapTonToJettonTxParams({
-  offerAmount: new TonWeb.utils.BN("1000000000"),
+  offerAmount: BigInt("1000000000"),
  // ...
});
```

- Operations with proxyTon now require an instance of pTON contract instead of just an address.

```diff
const txParams = await router.getSwapTonToJettonTxParams({
-  proxyTonAddress: pTON.v1.address,
+  proxyTon: new pTON.v1(),
  // ...
});
```

- The `get*TxParams` methods now return objects with the type `SenderArguments` instead of `MessageData`. The purpose and shape of those objects almost identical, but these changes allow us to fit ton-core notation better and implement `send*`
methods

Before
```js
const txParams = await router.getSwapTonToJettonTxParams({ /** */ }); // { to, payload, gasAmount }
```

After
```js
const txParams = await router.getSwapTonToJettonTxParams({ /** */ }); // { to, body, value }
```

- `RouterV1.getData` method was renamed to `RouterV1.getRouterData` to match contract API
- `PoolV1.getData` method was renamed to `PoolV1.getPoolData` to match contract API
- `LpAccountV1.getData` method was renamed to `LpAccountV1.getLpAccountData` to match contract API
- `gasConstants` for swap using Router v1 has been decreased

### Added

- Contracts now have static `create` method to simplify instance creation.

```js
import { FARM } from '@ston-fi/sdk/farm/v3';

const nft = FARM.NftItem.create('EQ...');
```

- Contracts now have `send*` methods to simplify transaction sending with the @ton-core package

```js
const wallet = client.open(WalletContractV4.create({ workchain, publicKey: keyPair.publicKey }));
const router = client.open(new DEX.v1.Router());

await router.sendSwapTonToJetton(
  wallet.sender(keyPair.secretKey),
  {
    // tx arguments for `getSwapTonToJettonTxParams` method to build tx params
  },
);
```

- `RouterV1.getPoolAddressByJettonMinters` method was added to simplify pool address determination by jetton minter addresses. Not router jetton wallet addresses as required in `RouterV1.getPoolAddress` method.

```js
const pool = openedRouter.getPoolAddressByJettonMinters({
  token0: 'EQA2kCVNwVsil2EM2mB0SkXytxCqQjS4mttjDpnXmwG9T6bO', // STON minter
  token1: 'EQBX6K9aXVl3nXINCyPPL86C4ONVmQ8vK360u6dykFKXpHCa', // GEMSTON minter
})
```

### Removed

- `MessageData` has been replaced with `SenderArguments` type
- `*_OP_CODES` enum exports was removed
- `parse*` util functions exports was removed

## [0.5.3]

### Added

- Direct exports of `DEX` & `FARM` contracts of a specific version were added. If you are only interested in using, for example Farm v3 contracts specifically, now you can import only this version instead of an object with all versions.

```diff
- import { FARM } from "@ston-fi/sdk";
+ import { FARM } from "@ston-fi/sdk/farm/v3";

- const farm = new FARM.v3.NftMinter(/** */);
+ const farm = new FARM.NftMinter(/** */);
```

## [0.5.2]

### Changed

- contracts `create*Body` methods is public now
- jetton wallet address request in the `PoolV1.getJettonWallet` and `RouterV1.getPool` methods was changed from TonAPI to StonAPI

### Fixed

- Correct type for `FarmNftMinterV3.getVersion` `major` and `minor` fields. It was typed as a `number` but, in fact, was `BN`.

## [0.5.1]

### Changed

- `poolCount` in `FarmNftMinterV3.buildStakeTxParams` is now optional

## [0.5.0]

> **Breaking changes**
> Please look at the **Changed** section or at the [step-by-step migration guide](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/sdk/0.4-migration-guide)

### Added

- Farm v1 contract
- Farm v3 contract
- pTON v1 contract
- If excess gas was defined in DEX operation, it will now be returned to the user's wallet address
- All SDK transactions now use bounceable addresses for `to` tx parameter
- SDK package now tree shakable

### Changed

- Contract revisions have been dropped

The original idea of having revision classes was to have the Contract class unchanged
and only make a new revision each time we introduce a new contract version.
In reality, each new version of the contract drastically varies from the previous one
so it became impossible to maintain a single abstracted interface on top of the revisions

Revision as a term was removed from the SDK, and now each contract has a static
`version` field to help identify the version of the contract.

Version enum keys was also changed from `V*` to `v*` to match with the StonFi API responses

Before
```js
import { Router, ROUTER_REVISION } from '@ston-fi/sdk';

const router = new Router(/** */, {
  revision: ROUTER_REVISION.V1
  // ...
});
```

After
```js
import { DEX } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

const router = new DEX.v1.Router(/** */)
```

- Contract constructor now accepts a single object with named parameters

Every SDK contract extends the contract from the TonWeb package. We are faced with the necessity
of passing custom fields along with those that are required by the TonWeb constructors.
With a new constructor parameters will now be able to pass comfortably
any parameters to the contracts and process them before passing them down to the TonWeb constructors

Now it became possible to partially or completely override default operations gas constants
in the constructor parameters. Previously it was required to create a custom revision
with overridden gas constants and pass it to the contract constructor to do so.

Before
```js
import TonWeb from 'tonweb';
import { Router, ROUTER_REVISION, ROUTER_REVISION_ADDRESS } from '@ston-fi/sdk';

const router = new Router(new TonWeb.HttpProvider(), {
  revision: ROUTER_REVISION.V1,
  address: ROUTER_REVISION_ADDRESS.V1,
});
```

After
```js
import TonWeb from 'tonweb';
import { DEX } from "@ston-fi/sdk";

const router = new DEX.v1.Router({
  tonApiClient: new TonWeb.HttpProvider()
});
```

- DEX swap methods were renamed

We received a lot of questions about how to swap jetton to TON because it uses the `buildSwapJettonTxParams.`
method with changed `askJettonAddress` parameter. So, we did eliminate this unclearness by splitting
`buildSwapJettonTxParams` method to `buildSwapJettonToJettonTxParams` and `buildSwapTonToJettonTxParams` methods.
`buildSwapProxyTonTxParams` was renamed to `buildSwapTonToJettonTxParams` to unify the naming convention.

Also, because there are now three independent methods, we were able to adjust gas constants
for each operation type, reducing the cost of the swap.

Before
```js
const swapJettonToJettonParams = await router.buildSwapJettonTxParams(/** */);
const swapJettonToTonParams = await router.buildSwapJettonTxParams({
  /** */
  askJettonAddress: PROXY_TON_ADDRESS,
});
const swapTonToJettonParams = await router.buildSwapProxyTonTxParams(/** */);
```

After
```js
const swapJettonToJettonParams = await router.buildSwapJettonToJettonTxParams(/** */);
const swapJettonToTonParams = await router.buildSwapJettonToTonTxParams(/** */);
const swapTonToJettonParams = await router.buildSwapTonToJettonTxParams(/** */);
```

- Interface of the Router v1 `getPoolAddress` method was unified with the `getPoolAddress`

Before
```js
const pool = await router.getPool({
  jettonAddresses: ["EQ...ABC", "EQ...CBA"],
});
```

After
```js
const pool = await router.getPool({
  token0: "EQ...ABC",
  token1: "EQ...CBA"
});
```

### Removed

### Changed

- DEX contracts moved to the `contracts/dex` directory
- DEX contracts usage examples in `/examples` directory was prefixed with "dex-"
